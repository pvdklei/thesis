# My bachelors thesis project
All the code used in my bachelor's thesis about tangent space normal mapping and plane-based geometric algebra.

# Running it yourself
To visually check out the implementations of tangent space normal mapping I made run `cargo run --bin main`. To run the performance benchmark, run `bash bench.sh`.
